- 👋 Hi, I’m @emmanuel-olateju
- 👀 I’m a student and a researh assistant with focus on decoding of physiological data using Deep/Machine-learning architectures and development of rehabilitation robots/control systems
- 👀 My journey as a student of electronic/electrical engineering has seen me develop experstise in several areas, theoreticall and practically
  - In my freshman, sophomore and middle years, I acquired skills in areas of embedded systems, analog electronics and FPGA based development
  - My penultimate year involved developing skills in areas of brain-computer-interacing, signal-processing, machine-learning, computational-neuroscience and rehabilitation robotics
  - My final year made sure that all of these acquired skills are continously honed and refined in bith the theoretical and practical sense by applying them more actively in research and development.
- 🌱 Here are some of my recent research works and projects. All of my research works is done under a research laboratory within my faculty. 
  - Mismatch Negativity and EEG measures for schizophrenia prognosis
  - (PULSR) Platform for Upper Limb Stroe Rehabilitation
  - CNN and EEG Engagement-Indexer for During Session Upper Extremity Rehabilitation  
  - Development of an EEG motor-imagery based grasp,release classifier
  - SSVEP based keypad
- 🌱 In the past, I have been an embedded systems developer and an analog electronics enthusiast, fields in which I completed lots of projects and achieved significant feats.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Machine-learning and Artificial-Intelligence projects utilizing human physiological data and other forms of data(financial).
