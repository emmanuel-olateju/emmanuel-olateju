- 👋 Hi, I'm Emmanuel Olateju, a graduate of Electronic Engineering and a research assistant at [A2IR2](https://appliedair.oauife.edu.ng). I am an enthusiast of applying engineering concepts in developing medical solutions for rehabilitation, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. As such my skillset/areas of interest include but is not limited to:
  - Machine learning and Deep learning
  - Signals processing(electrophysiological signals)
  - Embedded Systems(baremetal, RTOS, Embedded Linux & FPGA based development)
  - Robotics
  - Computational Medicine
  - Computational Neuroscience
  - Brain Computer Interfacing
- As such you will find me on projects that involve rehabilitation robots, learning methods for health diagnostics/prognostics, human computer interaction and neuroscience research. 
- 👀 While being a student, a research assistant and a time to time freelancer, I have tried out various things and picked up various skillset in areas of machine-learning, deep-learning, embedded systems development, software development and DevOps practices. A bit of specifics on a few of the tools I have used:
  - Machine/Deep Learning: ...., pandas, seaborn, tableau, scikit, xgboost, CATBoost, tensorflow, pytorch, AutoML, ....... 
  - Embedded systems: ....., Embedded C, atmel, PIC, STM32, Raspberry-Pi, DE10Lite FPGA, NexysA7 FPGA, .......
  - Software: Python, C++
  - DevOps: ....., Docker, Kubernetes, Github Actions, Gitlab CI/CD, Azure, AWS, ........
- 🌱 Major works I have contributed to include
  - Mismatch Negativity and EEG measures for schizophrenia prognosis
  - (PULSR) Platform for Upper Limb Stroe Rehabilitation
  - Research on relation between basal-ganglia activity and reward circuitry presence in tasks
  - CNN and EEG Engagement-Indexer for During Session Upper Extremity Rehabilitation 
  - Development of a EEG controlled hand-orthosis 
  - Development of an EEG motor-imagery based grasp,release classifier
