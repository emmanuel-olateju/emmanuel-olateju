- 👋 Hi, I’m @emmanuel-olateju
- 👀 I’m a student and a researh assistant with focus on decoding of physiological data using Deep/Machine-learning architectures and development of rehabilitation robots/control systems
- 👀 My journey as a student of electronic/electrical engineering has seen me develop experstise in several areas, theoreticall and practically
  - In my freshman, sophomore and middle years, I acquired skills in areas of embedded systems, analog electronics and FPGA based development
  - My penultimate year involved developing skills in areas of brain-computer-interacing, signal-processing, machine-learning, computational-neuroscience and rehabilitation robotics
  - My final year made sure that all of these acquired skills are continously honed and refined in bith the theoretical and practical sense by applying them more actively in research and development.
- 🌱 Here are some of my recent research works and projects. All of my research works is done under a research laboratory within my faculty. 
  - Mismatch Negativity and EEG measures for schizophrenia prognosis
  - (PULSR) Platform for Upper Limb Stroe Rehabilitation
  - CNN and EEG Engagement-Indexer for During Session Upper Extremity Rehabilitation 
  - Development of a EEG controlled hand-orthosis 
  - Development of an EEG motor-imagery based grasp,release classifier
  - SSVEP based keypad
- 🌱 In the hardware world, I developed some projects before my penultimate year. Some of which are 
  - PPG based glucose indexer
  - Mini audio amplifier
  - Small signal amplifier
  - FPGA based traffick controller
  - FPGA based analog voltage data acquisition system
  - FPGA based timer&stopwatch
  - FPGA based arithmetic logical unit
  - Password/fingerprint based security system with voice feedback using Arduino.
  - Heartbeat counter using ESP8266 and Blynk app.
  - Water pumping control system using PIC microcontroller.
  - Development of automatic transfer switch system for generators.
- 💞️ I’m looking towards participating in research that contribute to quality of hman life through puse of physiological data and development of rehabilitation robots and other kind of robots.
