- üëã Hi, I'm Emmanuel Olateju, a student and research assistant with expertise in decoding physiological data using deep/machine-learning architectures and developing rehabilitation robots/control & instrumentation systems. I am also a DevOps methodology enthusiast in my sparetime and have practiced with several DevOps technologies while also developing a little experience through freelancing. Some technologies I picked up from DevOps practices include:
  - Scripting & Programming: Bash, Python, C++
  - Cloud: DigitalOcean, AWS, Azure
  - Containerization & Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes
  - CI/CD: Jenkins, Gitlab CI/CD
  - IaC: Terraform
- üëÄ Throughout my academic journey in electronic/electrical engineering, I have acquired expertise in several areas.
  - In my freshman, sophomore and middle years, I acquired skills in areas of embedded systems, analog electronics and FPGA based development
  - My penultimate year involved developing skills in areas of brain-computer-interacing, signal-processing, machine-learning, computational-neuroscience and rehabilitation robotics
  - My final year made sure that all of these acquired skills are continously honed and refined in both the theoretical and practical sense by applying them more actively in research and development.
- üå± I have worked on several research projects under a research laboratory within my faculty which include: 
  - Mismatch Negativity and EEG measures for schizophrenia prognosis
  - (PULSR) Platform for Upper Limb Stroe Rehabilitation
  - CNN and EEG Engagement-Indexer for During Session Upper Extremity Rehabilitation 
  - Development of a EEG controlled hand-orthosis 
  - Development of an EEG motor-imagery based grasp,release classifier
  - SSVEP based keypad
- üå± In addition, I have developed several hardware projects which include the following:
  - PPG based glucose indexer
  - Mini audio amplifier
  - Small signal amplifier
  - FPGA based traffick controller
  - FPGA based analog voltage data acquisition system
  - FPGA based timer&stopwatch
  - FPGA based arithmetic logical unit
  - Password/fingerprint based security system with voice feedback using Arduino.
  - Heartbeat counter using ESP8266 and Blynk app.
  - Water pumping control system using PIC microcontroller.
  - Development of automatic transfer switch system for generators.
- üíûÔ∏è I am looking forward to participating in research and projects that contributes to the quality of human life through the use of physiological data and development of rehabilitation robots and other kinds of robots.
